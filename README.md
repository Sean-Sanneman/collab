# Collab

## Description

Collab is a website being developed to help musicians find other musicians to collaborate with remotely. Our MVP allows people to create a user account, and search for other users/bands by instruments and genres. Collab will eventually become a social networking platform where musicians can communicate about the projects they are working on, share project files, find people to record tracks for their project, etc.
